Who knows if someone comes and locks it\n                up every night and reopens it every morning; but to\n                be safe, please show up at \"normal\" hours during\n                daylight The Guestbook is on the ground floor, just a\n                few feet from it on a desk No picture of your entry\n                required, although it would be nice if you did There\n                are hundreds of information brouchures on Finger\n                Lakes attractions, help yourself There is an outdoor\n                stairway to the 2nd floor of the windmill, but it is\n                used for storage, and the door is locked\n\n                Historical information source:\n                http://wwwcosenecanyus/history/The%20Windmill%20article%20with%20picturesdoc\n                by Walter Gable, Seneca County Historian\n\n                <br>"

The piers\n                supporting the spans that are in the water for the\n                1935 bridge feature stone cutwaters, while the 1962\n                bridge has steel plates wrapped around the stone\n                cutwaters Additionally, there are differences in the\n                sway bracing on the two bridges, but I certainly have\n                never noticed, nor can tell the difference Me, I just\n                know heading to Niagara Falls, newer bridge, heading\n                to Buffalo, older bridge\n\n                So you can park at the coordinates I give you, and\n                it's about 25 miles to the cache I'd stongly suggest\n                that you leave the Riverwalk, and walk right\n                alongside the fence seperating NOCO Energy Corp\n                property from public riverfront property This way,\n                you will avoid bushwacking through a nasty swamp!\n\n                There is quite a bit of trash in this area, I'd say\n                most of it left by thoughtless fishermen I myself did\n                CITO a bag of trash when checking the coordinates\n                before publishing (I had left the cache sitting in\n                the woods for a week unpublished) Please bring a bag\n                along and do some of this yourself Except I don't\n                expect you to trash out discarded tires on rims\n\n                A November placement, and the bushwacking isn't too\n                bad, but I'd suspect there's quite a bit in the late\n                Spring, Summer, and early Fall I also believe there\n                is a lot of poison ivy in the area And yes, there\n                really is a beach Oh, the cache fits very snugly in\n                it's hiding spot, please place it back the same way,\n                and it should be fine\n\n                \u00a0\n\n                \u00a0\n\n                <br>"

Frisbee Golf, of\n                course It's more commonly known as Disc Golf But lets\n                face it, calling it Disc Golf is not funny Calling it\n                Frolf is I suppose Dolf is kind of funny, but not as\n                funny as Frolf I'm sure you've seen one of these\n                things before This is a Disc Golf \"Hole\" It seems to\n                be usually called a goal or a basket, but we're going\n                to call them holes for the purposes of this cache\n\n\n                The Coordinates at the top of the page will take you\n                to a kiosk, or sign, if you will This lists sponsors\n                for the 18 holes of the Ellicott Creek Park Frolf\n                course There are always at least 1 sponsor per hole,\n                and a maximum of 5 You just need to do a little work\n                looking at the sponsors for given holes to figure out\n                where the end cache is, a lock-n-lock container that\n                I'd describe as just barely a normal sized, as\n                opposed to small size The end cache coordinates are\n                in the format:\n\n                North 43 01ABC\n\n                West 078 49DEF\n\n                A = The number of sponsors of hole # 15\n                B = The number of sponsors of hole # 2 MINUS the\n                number of sponsors of hole # 1\n                C = The hole number that is sponsored by NRDG\n                D = The hole number that is sponsored by Alan and\n                Justin\n                E = The number of sponsors of hole # 13\n                F = The hole number sponsored by Andy and Chris\n\n                The end cache is well under 1/2 mile away You can\n                probably drive your vehicle within about 400 feet of\n                it But why not walk it like a Frolfer would? No crazy\n                bushwacking is required!! Look for a way in, there\n                definitely is one Once you find this easy way in,\n                this is a very simple traditional hide in the woods\n                I'd describe as 1 star difficulty, assuming my\n                coordinates are good Please re-cover well, as there\n                is some kids \"teepee building\" activity in the woods\n                And don't worry about all those 3-leaved plants near\n                the cache, they're wild raspberry, not poison ivy\n                Trust me\n\n                <br>"

Whether you approach from\n                the North or South, there are a flight of 5 or 6 very\n                high (I'd guess 18\"-24\") steps to get down to the\n                Museum Approaching from the North, you will have to\n                negotiate the Niagara Escarpment via steps and an\n                inclined paved path You can avoid the escarpment by\n                approaching from the South, but you'll still have to\n                deal with the concrete steps\n\n                Seasonal Considerations! This small Museum has no\n                website But Niagara-USAcom says it is open 7 days a\n                week from 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM from May to October The\n                Lockport Cave tour guide tells me it's open\n                year-round those hours I tend to believe\n                Niagara-USAcom, so we will see what happens there, as\n                the cache was submitted early in the tourist season\n                It may very well be accessable only 6 months out of\n                the year, and will be disabled the other 6\n\n                <br><img\n                src=\"http://www.opencaching.us/images/uploads/1CE6C6C9-AA8B-244B-E4D9-0806F577BFFC.jpg\"><br>I\n                stole this pic off the internets lol front of Museum<br><img\n                src=\"http://www.opencaching.us/images/uploads/792B4DC0-382C-ADF3-0E78-CF719F6631F9.jpg\"><br>The\n                guestbook itself<br><img\n                src=\"http://www.opencaching.us/images/uploads/C3F92F7A-024A-6FC6-8D28-97279DE67244.jpg\"><br>An\n                old Generator in the Museum<br>"

the Genesee County Board of Supervisors met\n                in Bethany for the purpose of establishing a County\n                Poorhouse\u00a0 A brick building, originally a stagecoach\n                tavern, located near the corner of the Bethany Center\n                Road and Raymond Road was the site selected, as it\n                represented the geographical center of the county\n                (Wyoming County wasn\u2019t established until 1841) The\n                following official announcement, dated December 9,\n                1826, appeared in an issue of the Batavia Times\n

liquor)\u00a0 Another\n                document noted that a man had died leaving behind a\n                widow and fatherless children and with no means of\n                support the mother and children become residents of\n                the County Home\n\n                In 1828 the County constructed a stone building\n                attached to the Poorhouse for the confinement of\n                lunatics and a repository for paupers committed for\n                misconduct\u00a0 The insane were also housed at the County\n                Home until 1887 when the Board of

Well, you're on your own then Models\n                and mobile web browsers vary greatly\n\n                As I said before, not the greatest webcam, but I\n                think it will work As long as there is a discernable\n                human figure standing there looking towards the\n                camera, you'll be fine\u00a0 Feel free to hold up your\n                GPS, or flap your arms if you like Oh, and of course\n                if you look down over the railing in the picture\n                above, you will see Lock #35 on the New York State\n                Barge Canal, AKA The Erie Canal Locks 34 and 35 raise\n                or lower boats approximately 50 feet at the Niagara\n                Escarpment\n\n                <br>"

But the picture was still\n                        changing on the website!
